Role & Objective: Act as a Senior Frontend Engineer. Refactor the Vanilla JS Pac-Man game code above into a modular, production-ready React application using Vite.

Project Structure & Architecture:

    Framework: React 18+ (Functional Components with Hooks).

    Build Tool: Vite.

    Styling: CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS (your preference).

    File Structure: Break the monolithic code into logical files:

        /src/components: UI components (Scoreboard, GameOverScreen).

        /src/game: The core game engine logic (non-React classes).

        /src/hooks: Custom hooks for game loop or input.

Key Refactoring Instructions (Critical):

    Separation of Concerns: Do not put the game loop or entity positions into React State (useState). This will cause performance issues due to excessive re-rendering.

        Create a pure JavaScript class (e.g., GameEngine.js) to handle the game loop (requestAnimationFrame), physics, and collision detection.

        Use a useRef to access the <canvas> element and pass it to the GameEngine.

        Only use React State for UI overlays (e.g., score, lives, isGameOver, isPaused). The GameEngine should emit events or call callbacks to update these specific React states.

    Third-Party Libraries:

        You may use react-use for input handling (e.g., useKey) if it simplifies code.

        You may use framer-motion for the "Game Over" or "Start" screen animations.

Component Requirements:

    GameCanvas.jsx: Wraps the HTML5 Canvas. Initializes the GameEngine in a useEffect.

    ScoreBoard.jsx: Displays current score and high score.

    App.jsx: The main layout container.

Deliverables: Provide the code split into multiple file blocks.

    package.json (listing dependencies).

    src/game/GameEngine.js (The logic refactored from the previous code).

    src/components/GameCanvas.jsx (The React wrapper).

    src/App.jsx (The entry point).

Goal: Clean, maintainable code that keeps the 60FPS performance of the original while leveraging React for the UI.
