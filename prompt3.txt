Role & Objective: Act as a Creative Game Designer and Lead Developer. Build upon the React/Vite Pac-Man application we just created. Your goal is to modernize the game to make it "better than the arcade" by adding "Game Juice" (visual feedback), a distinct visual style, and new gameplay mechanics.

New Feature Requirements:

    Visual Overhaul (Cyberpunk/Neon Style):

        Change the aesthetic from flat colors to a "Neon/Glow" style.

        Use Canvas shadowBlur and shadowColor to make the walls and Pac-Man glow.

        Dynamic background: A subtle grid or vignette effect instead of plain black.

    Particle System ("Juice"):

        Create a Particle class and a ParticleSystem within the GameEngine.

        Trigger: When Pac-Man eats a pellet, spawn small sparks.

        Trigger: When a Ghost is eaten, trigger a large "explosion" of particles matching the ghost's color.

        Trigger: When Pac-Man dies, playing a disintegration effect.

    New Gameplay Mechanics (Modern Twist):

        Sprint Mechanic: Allow the player to hold Shift to move 50% faster for a short duration (add a "Stamina Bar" to the UI overlay).

        New Power-Ups: randomly spawn a "Fruit" item that, when eaten, freezes all ghosts in place for 5 seconds (Ice Effect).

    Technical Implementation:

        Modify GameEngine.js to include the particle update/draw loop.

        Update GameCanvas.jsx or ScoreBoard.jsx to render the new Stamina Bar (pass stamina value via callback).

        Ensure the particle rendering does not drag the frame rate below 60fps (cull particles when they fade out).

Deliverables:

    Updated GameEngine.js (incorporating particles, glow styles, and sprint logic).

    Updated ScoreBoard.jsx (adding the visual Stamina meter).

    A summary of the changes made.

Goal: Transform the game from a "clone" into a "modern retro remix" that feels highly responsive and visually exciting.
